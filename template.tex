%   PACKAGES %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
%   Add any packages you need for your thesis here.
%   You don't need to call the following packages, which are already called in
%   the sfuthesis class file:
%
%   - appendix
%   - etoolbox
%   - fontenc
%   - geometry
%   - lmodern
%   - nowidow
%   - setspace
%   - tocloft
%
%   If you call one of the above packages (or one of their dependencies) with
%   options, you may get a "Option clash" LaTeX error. If you get this error,
%   you can fix it by removing your copy of \usepackage and passing the options
%   you need by adding
%
%       \PassOptionsToPackage{<options>}{<package>}
%
%   before \documentclass{sfuthesis}.
%
%   The following packages are a few suggestions you might find useful.
%
%   (1) amsmath and amssymb are essential if you have math in your thesis;
%       they provide useful commands like ``blackboard bold'' symbols and
%       environments for aligning equations.
%   (2) amsthm includes allows you to easily change the style and numbering of
%       theorems. It also provides an environment for proofs.
%   (3) graphicx allows you to add images with \includegraphics{filename}.
%   (4) hyperref turns your citations and cross-references into clickable
%       links, and adds metadata to the compiled PDF.
%   (5) pdfpages lets you import pages of external PDFs using the command
%       \includepdf{filename}. You will need to do this if your research
%       requires an Ethics Statement.
%

\usepackage{amsmath}                            % (1)
\usepackage{amssymb}                            % (1)
\usepackage{amsthm}                             % (2)
\usepackage{graphicx}                           % (3)
\usepackage[pdfborder={0 0 0}]{hyperref}        % (4)
% \usepackage{pdfpages}                         % (5)

%   OTHER CUSTOMIZATIONS %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
%   Add any packages you need for your thesis here. We've started you off with
%   a few suggestions.
%
%   (1) Use a single word space between sentences. If you disable this, you
%       will have to manually control spacing around abbreviations.
%   (2) Correct the capitalization of "Chapter" and "Section" if you use the
%       \autoref macro from the `hyperref` package.
%   (3) The LaTeX thesis template defaults to one-and-a-half line spacing. If
%       your supervisor prefers double-spacing, you can redefine the
%       \defaultspacing command.
%

\frenchspacing                                    % (1)
\renewcommand*{\chapterautorefname}{Chapter}      % (2)
\renewcommand*{\sectionautorefname}{Section}      % (2)
\renewcommand*{\subsectionautorefname}{Section}   % (2)
% \renewcommand{\defaultspacing}{\doublespacing}  % (3)
