thesis-template
===============

You’re a graduate student preparing to write your thesis or dissertation. Where should you start? This project—a LaTeX class and an example template—is a reasonable place to begin. The `uvicthesis` class does most of the work towards making your thesis conform to the University of Victoria's style requirements. If for some reason you *don't* go to UVic, the clean source code should make it easy to tweak to your specific needs. 

Installation
------------

1. If you don't already have a LaTeX distribution, [install one][dl].

2. Download `template.tex`, `uvicthesis.cls`, and `references.bib`, making sure to save them in the same folder. 

3. Rename `template.tex` to something more suitable.

4. Delete the main content and replace it with your own.

5. Compile it!
